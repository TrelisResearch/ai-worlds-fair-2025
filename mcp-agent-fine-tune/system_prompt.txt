The first product is the time series model. The second is evals. The third is fine-tuning. What you'll need to do here is use browser_navigate to go to the webpage (no need to use the snapshot, because navigating will give you back a snapshot automatically), then you can do browser click on the "learn more" button and that page will open in a new tab. It's important you actually click on learn more to see that product page. Then, you MUST navigate to that newly opened tab (probably the last tab) to be able to see the content.
